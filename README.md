Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

CSS:
- CSS styling of the primary visual elements in the application
- Various CSS Selector functionality must be demonstrated:
    - Element selectors
    - ID selectors
    - Class selectors
- CSS positioning and styling of the primary visual elements in the application:
    - Use of either a CSS grid or flexbox for layout
    - Rules defining fonts for all text used; no default fonts! Be sure to use a web safe font or a font from a web service like [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com/)

- CSS defined in a maintainable, readable form, in external stylesheets 

## To-Do List App
**Link**: https://a2-mareksgarbaczonek.glitch.me/

- This project is a to-do list application. A user can add tasks, set their priorities, and add due dates. In the future, the app would also determine if the task would be assigned for today or just be unassigned in all tasks page (Currently the diamond on the far right of each row is a placeholder for when I implement it).
- Once the user adds tasks, they can modify the task name, the priority, due date, or mark the task as complete.

**Description**: 
- My derived field is the due date for each task changes from a date and displays a message instead if the task is overdue, due today, or due tomorrow.

## Technical Achievements
**Base Technical Achievements**: 
- Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data.
- In addition to a form enabling adding and deleting data on the server, I also added the ability to modify existing data.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
**Base Design Achievements**: 
- Think aloud with Nathan Wong: He wanted a better indicator to show that you can edit a field like changing the name of the task could have been highlighted when hovering over it to indicate editability. He also went straight to editing sample tasks 1 and 2 before noticing the actual add task area. I was surprised and felt validated that he really liked my design and said it was very minimalistic and clean. Overall he said that he easily found everything he needed to. Based on his feedback, I made sure to indicate that a field can be edited in ways such as a highlight color when hovering over it.
- Think aloud with Mike McInerney: He was confused about the diamond buttons and wanted the ability to reorder tasks and potentially sort them. When he opened my site he said "OOOOO! This is very cool" and really liked how intuitive and visually appealing the interface was. Based on his feedback I would implement the ability to reorder and sort tasks but I did not manage to squeeze it in for A2 submission.
